# Project for Streamlit Workshop by [neuron.ai](https://neuron-ai.at/)

This was our small project for the streamlit workshop. 
Team consisted of [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-deutschbauer-933603254/?originalSubdomain=at), [Janis](https://github.com/JanisJoy) and [David](https://github.com/viddavue).

For using it you need to download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azharn/alligator-vs-crocodile1) and put it in the same folder as the code.
